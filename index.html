      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to think about epistemological questions and possible motivations behind people's actions. When I am not inside my brain,<br/>I like to watch 80s movies or take a nice walk somewhere. I usually jog at the beach during summer time; love to play around with my makeup, reading, shopping, being around goofy, down-to-earth kind-hearted people, cooking and relaxing at home.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be happy. As we grow into adulthood, what used to come naturally as children now requires work and creativity - happiness is a thing to work at.<br/> occupations that might help me get the "happiness" job done are: Software Engineer,Technical Campaign Manager, Data Analyst, Email Developer, Product Owner :) </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Whittier, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>So that I could be happy, buy a house for my future family by getting paid for doing something that I'm good at and that I love.</p>
